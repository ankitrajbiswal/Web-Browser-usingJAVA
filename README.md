## Conclusion
This Web Browser have been made with JAVA Fx using the concept of Multithreading. Few features are to be added like support for using multiple tabs at at time , Icoginito Browing and Bookmarks for the tabs and few changes in the UI will also be given by me and the code will also be optimized a bit, in order to make this a full fledged project.
